<h3>High Level Features</h3>


<h4>Check-In / Survey</h4>
 
Hypotheses: Users are interested in regularly checking in about how they are doing so they can share with people close to them and track their own progress over time

As a User, I can
record my mood 
answer a series of questions which may have categorical or numerical responses 
enter free form text comments about how I am doing
share check in and survey responses with friends


<h4>Peer Support</h4>

As a User, I can
invite another user to be a peer support friend
view a list of my friends, including simple information about how they are doing (ex: mood, whether they have flagged themselves as needing support)
drill down to view a profile for a given friend, including more detailed information about their status and recent activities 
create peer support groups, which friends can be added to
chat peer support friends (web-chat? SMS?) individually or by group chat (groupme api?)
flag myself as needing support


<h4>Goals + Reminders</h4>

As a User, I can
select active goals from a variety of pre-set goal options (ex: read literature, call sponsor, go to AA meeting, reach out to friend, do stepwork)
define settings for a given goal 
set goals to be one time or recurring on a daily or weekly basis
set goals to have a reminder at a specific time
view active goals assigned to today
view all active goals
receive/view alert-like notifications at assigned times which must be accepted as completed, snoozed, or rejected (sms?)


<h4>Gamified Progress</h4>

view current level and points value
view my most recent mood and check-in information (think about this)
view number of times they have completed a goal historically
view how many days in a row I have successfully completed all active goals
view amount of time I have been sober, which continuously updates
